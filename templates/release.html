      <h1>How and When Reports Are Released</h1>
      <p class="tagline">The truth matters — but timing can be everything.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p class="intro">
        Posterity Log is designed for a future reckoning. We do not release reports while authoritarian threats remain. All submissions are sealed until it is safe — or until 4 July 2100.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Control</h2>
      <p>
        When you submit a report, we generate multiple versions — from heavily sanitized to near-complete — and propose a release schedule for each. 
        You’ll always see these versions first, and can approve or reject each stage.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>🔒 Fully Redacted:</strong> No identifying details — for early public release and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>🕵️‍♂️ Lightly Redacted:</strong> Some context preserved — for release once threats diminish.</li>
        <li><strong>📜 Full Disclosure:</strong> Original report — only released once it's safe or at a future date you choose (e.g. 4 July 2100).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why the Delay?</h2>
      <p>
        Releasing too early risks retaliation. Many reports concern people still in power — or systems still weaponized against dissent.
        We wait until exposure can help, not harm.
      </p>

      <h2>Trigger Conditions for Release</h2>
      <p>
        Some versions may be scheduled for automatic release if certain conditions are met:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ A new administration takes office</li>
        <li>✅ Congressional inquiries begin</li>
        <li>✅ Public safety outweighs secrecy</li>
        <li>✅ You consent to earlier release</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="intro">
        We safeguard the record until the world is ready for it.<br>
        And when that day comes — the truth will speak for itself.
      </p>
